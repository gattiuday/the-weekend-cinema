# Movie App (Static Version)

Since `npm` was not available, this project was converted to a static HTML application that runs directly in the browser using CDNs.

## How to Run

1.  **Configure**: Open `config.js` and replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase configuration and API keys.
2.  **Run**: Simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser.

## Files

-   `index.html`: The entry point. Loads React, Firebase, and the App component.
-   `App.js`: The main React application code.
-   `config.js`: Configuration file for API keys.
